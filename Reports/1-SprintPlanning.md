# Story

"I need a screen where I can enter text with the title of a task, other text
with the description of this task and a deadline date for completion of this task.
I need the data to be stored in a relational database.
Initially I only need the software to save this information in the database and
new features will be mentioned in the next sprints."

Defining child tasks:

    1 - Implement relational database for Post-Its
    
    2 - Provide API connecting to the database
    
    3 - Control Screen
    
    4 - Button logic - Insert (text, description and date)
